- Started going through Nand2Tetris again from chapter one again after 2 years. Stopped at Chapter 8 2 years ago to focus on
making something that will make money for the company while I focus on research
- Studied chapter one from the main textbook, studied the hardware simulator tutorial PDF and then studied the lecture note
- I found it quite challenging to understand the simplification of the truth table to boolean expression on Slide 19 of the 
lecture note. This made me to go and search online for all the possible boolean functions. I took note of all of them and attempted
to derive them. I realized that "Distributive Law" is a very powerful law and somehow finds itself in a lot of examples as 
seen in the Boolean expression I was finding hard to understand. Here is the link to the document that shows all the laws of 
boolean expression: https://www.mi.mun.ca/users/cchaulk/misc/boolean.htm
- I did the HDL for NOT, AND and OR Gate
